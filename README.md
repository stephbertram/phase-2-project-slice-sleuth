# Slice Sleuth

You are invited to a mysterious pizzas parlor. You must discover which pizzas in this parlor is the real pizza. Compete with other detectives and get the highest score possible!

As a detective, you must submit your name and it will direct you to the Slice Sleuth portion of the application. Each user is given two rounds to play.

We plan to implement actual login feature that allows users to update their scores.
